Middleware:
is code that receives the request, does something and finally decides if it should go to the rest of the pipeline to handle the request or not. (for example, authentication)
its useful for request and response
works in async nature

Jade:
templating language to construct html from the server. its used as a view engine for node/express
its a language on its own and is not html, although it renders and constructs as html
it uses variables to make it dynamic, so depending of things in the request/response, it could
show or hide stuff
= is used for javascript, as a space is used to show as is (meaning, a string)


Socket.io
Real-time communitacion platform
- talk to server
- server talks to every client without need for more requests
- like signalR, but uses webSockets
- sends/receives events
- the variable that exists in the server is connected to the variable
that is declared in the client (not exactly the same var, but use same events)
